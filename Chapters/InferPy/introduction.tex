InferPy is a high-level API for probabilistic modeling written in Python and capable of running on top of Edward and Tensorflow. InferPy's API is strongly inspired by Keras and it has a focus on enabling flexible data processing, easy-to-code probablistic modeling, scalable inference and robust model validation.
