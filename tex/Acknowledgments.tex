I would first like to thank my tutor, Professor Serafín Moral Callejón, who has helped me greatly with his valuable guidance, corrections and advice in writing this document. I want to thank you for your patient support answering all my questions and doubts over the course of this project.

Rafael Cabañas and Jaakko Luttinen have assisted me in using \texttt{InferPy} and \texttt{BayesPy} respectively, answering my doubts about each framework usage, how to model Gaussian mixtures with them and each framework limitations.

In addition, I would like to thank my family for their support during this difficult situation of COVID-19 pandemic and my friends for putting up with me and keep reading drafts about this project.
